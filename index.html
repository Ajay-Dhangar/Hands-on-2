    <h2><i>What is CSS?</i></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, or in other media.</li>
        <li><del>CSS is not neccesary</del> <mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li><u>External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</u></li>
    </ol>
    <h2><i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <mark><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal style,</b></mark>because this is easier to demostrote, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style multiple elements.
        ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link
        directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selector are used to target a special element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style 
        or set of stylescan be applied to the elemenet.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target element to which a single should be applied.
